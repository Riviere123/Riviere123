ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Riviere123

I'm capable of coding in C#, Python, HTML, CSS, and Bash. 
I've recently completed 450+ hours of hands on technical instructions through Per Scholas in Linux, Python, Networking, Network Security, system hardening, and cloud infrastructure. 
I'm currently passionately coding in C# as a hobby for the past 3+ years in the Unity engine as well as making some automation scripts and scrapers in python. 
I've also created some small scale personal websites and deployed them to AWS cloud via EC2 instances for dynamic sites and S3 buckets for my static sites.
